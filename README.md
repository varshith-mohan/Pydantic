# Pydantic
Pydantic is a Python library used to validate and parse data using Python type hints. It ensures the data you receive (from API requests, JSON files, databases, etc.) is clean, correct, and in the expected format.  Pydantic is heavily used in FastAPI, data pipelines, ML model configs, and backend systems.
